  # Ported from Homebrew/homebrew-cask, which is disabling this cask on
  # 2026-09-01 because qBittorrent's macOS builds are self-signed rather than
  # notarised and so fail Gatekeeper. The app still installs and runs; macOS
  # blocks it on first launch until approved via
  # System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Open Anyway.
